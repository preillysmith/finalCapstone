Restaurant Website:

This repository is a website built as part of my Web Development bootcamp. It is a website for a restaurant, where specific features were required for the user, including a landing page, menu, and contact details.  As required, each page contains a “like” page system and “save for later” buttons.  This feature allows users to save images and text from the site into another page. It features a comments section and a mocked-up contact form. The website uses sessionStorage to perform these tasks.

For installation and usage:

Download all files and open one of the html files in a browser, each page can be linked from the other.
